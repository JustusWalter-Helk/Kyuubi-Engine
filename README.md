# Kyuubi-Engine

## How to navigate
Kyuubiforge is the backend engine.
Kyuubieditor is the editor which uses the engine to create games.

## About
Kyuubi is a simple 2D Engine (with editor) built in Java 17.

(There may be 3D Support in the future)

Its built in my spare time and currently does not support other operating systems than Windows.

Im currently following this [tutorial series](https://github.com/codingminecraft/MarioYoutube) to learn about lwjgl.
The goal is not to recreate mario but to take the concepts explained and build them into a functional engine.

As soon as i understand the concepts and im confident enough in applying those a lot of reworking will be done to better fit a game engine.

## Development
If you want to help with development you can do so by messaging me on discord (Kreiseljustus#1567) or by opening a pull request!
There are a lot of remnants of older systems in the code base which could be removed. 

Some classes need reworks really soon like the Window class, so this would be a good place to start.
