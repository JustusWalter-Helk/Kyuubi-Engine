# Kyuubi-Engine
## How to navigate
Kyuubiforge is the backend engine.
Kyuubieditor is the editor which uses the engine to create games.

## About
Kyuubi is a simple 2D Engine (with editor) built in Java 17.

(There may be 3D Support in the future)

Its built in my spare time and currently does not support other operating systems than Windows.

Im currently following this [tutorial series](https://github.com/codingminecraft/MarioYoutube) to learn about lwjgl.
The goal is not to recreate mario but to take the concepts explained and build them into a functional engine.

Im not following the tutorial series in order. A good example is that there will be a GameObject system before 
texture loading is implemented. (In the series the texture loading is implemented first)
As soon as i understand the concepts and im confident enough in applying those a lot of reworking will be done to better fit a game engine.
